The CAIRN demo is coming soon.

When it launches, you'll be able to:

- Explore a simulated calendar and email environment
- Watch CAIRN observe, distill, and propose workflow optimizations
- Accept, reject, or modify every lesson CAIRN learns
- See the full reasoning behind every suggestion

No account required to browse the site. A magic link login gates the interactive demo — we'll ask for your email, send you a one-time link, and that's it. [Read exactly what we store.](/privacy)

> *This demo will run on HuggingFace infrastructure so you can try CAIRN today. The production product runs entirely on your machine. We eat our own cooking — we're just not done cooking yet.*
