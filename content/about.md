## The problem

Every major AI assistant today operates on the same model: your data goes up to a cloud, gets processed by someone else's infrastructure, and the insights come back down. You're told to trust the process. You're rarely shown the reasoning. You can't edit what the system learned about you. You can't delete it with confidence.

This isn't a technical limitation. It's a business model. Your data is the product, and your attention is the yield.

## What we believe

We believe AI should work *for* you in the most literal sense — running on your hardware, learning only what you approve, and remaining fully transparent about its reasoning.

We believe that the right response to "trust me" is "show me."

We believe small, focused models tuned to your context will outperform massive general-purpose models for the tasks that actually matter in your day — because they're *yours*.

And we believe that if we can't build AI that respects autonomy, we shouldn't build AI at all.

## The name

A talking rock doesn't move. It doesn't follow you. It sits where you put it, and when you ask, it speaks — clearly, honestly, without agenda. It's grounded.

That's what we're building. AI that's grounded in your values, your data, your terms. Not a system that watches you from the cloud and whispers suggestions optimized for engagement.

A rock that talks when spoken to. And only says what it can show you.

## Who we are

Talking Rock AI is building CAIRN — Contextual AI with Reviewable Negotiation. We're a small team focused on a big bet: that the future of AI is local, transparent, and human-directed.

We're not done yet. But we're building in the open, and you can watch — or help.
