## What is Cairn?

Cairn is a local-first AI assistant that prioritizes your autonomy over its own convenience. It runs on your machine, learns from your patterns only with explicit consent, and makes every lesson it distills reviewable, editable, and reversible.

**C**ontextual — understands your workflows, schedule, and priorities in context.
**A**I — small language models that run on consumer hardware.
**R**eviewable — every inference, every learned pattern is surfaced for your inspection.
**N**egotiation — Cairn proposes. You decide. Always.

## How it works

Cairn observes your digital environment — calendar, email, task lists — and proposes prioritization, scheduling, and workflow optimizations. But it never acts unilaterally.

Every suggestion follows the same cycle:

1. **Observe** — Cairn notices a pattern or context signal
2. **Distill** — it formulates a lesson or recommendation
3. **Propose** — it presents the lesson to you with full reasoning
4. **Negotiate** — you accept, reject, or modify the lesson
5. **Learn** — accepted lessons shape future behavior; rejected ones are discarded

No lesson persists without your consent. No action is taken without your approval. No data leaves your machine.

## Why small models?

Large language models require cloud infrastructure, which means your data travels. Cairn uses small, efficient models (7B parameters and under) that run entirely on your hardware.

This isn't a compromise — it's a design choice. Small models fine-tuned to your context outperform general-purpose giants for personal workflows. And they do it without sending your calendar to a data center.

## Try the demo

The Cairn demo is coming soon. When it launches, you'll be able to:

- Explore a simulated calendar and email environment
- Watch Cairn observe, distill, and propose workflow optimizations
- Accept, reject, or modify every lesson Cairn learns
- See the full reasoning behind every suggestion

No account required to browse. A magic link login gates the interactive demo — we'll ask for your email, send you a one-time link, and that's it. [Read exactly what we store.](/privacy)

> *The demo will run on HuggingFace infrastructure so you can try Cairn without local setup. The production product runs entirely on your machine. We eat our own cooking — we're just not done cooking yet.*
